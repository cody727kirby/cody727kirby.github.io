While others such as James Brown, Gladys Knight and most notably Diana Ross would take credit for &quot;discovering&quot; the Jackson 5, it was Taylor who had the greatest impact on them initially.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Taylor put his singing career on hold and worked on producing the Jackson 5&#39;s first five albums. He also wrote the group&#39;s early hits Ben, ABC, I Want You Back, I&#39;ll Be There and Maybe Tomorrow. His work, however, went uncredited when he fell out with the Motown brass. He later sued the label and won but claims he has yet to see any money.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I worked a lot with Michael Jackson. He was eight at the time. He was the voice. He had the tools. He screamed a lot. He was a James Brown at that time. Jermaine was okay and Jackie was okay.

We went to Motown after opening at the Apollo Theater and we had a choice to go on Merv Griffin or go to Motown and do an audition and we decided to go to Motown &nbsp;we thought it would be the best situation for us &nbsp;we auditioned for Motown after Berry heard the tape, then he invited us to a swim party &nbsp;indoor pool, all that &nbsp;he was throwing a party for Diana Ross and all the artists were there, the Temptations, all those artists &nbsp;and we sang for them, and as they say the rest is history.&rdquo;</span></p></body>
