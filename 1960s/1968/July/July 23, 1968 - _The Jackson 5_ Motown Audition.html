And he was a very imposing figure. And I was so happy to be at Motown and I was asked to come to see this group at Bobby Taylor&#39;s apartment. We lived in the same apartment building.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And I walked in and I saw these kids. And they were unbelievable. And I called Mr. Gordy and I said, oh, I&#39;ve just seen the most fantastic act. And he said, great. And I said, yes, these kids. He said, kids? I don&#39;t want any kids. Stevie Wonder is enough of a handful. Go find some talented adults basically.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And, you know, I was terribly new and terribly green. And I didn&#39;t know what to do. And I just had been so profoundly affected by their talent that I went back one more time, mustered up all my courage. And I said, Mr. Gordy, you just have to see these kids. And he finally relented and he agreed to audition them. And the rest is history.</span></p></body>
