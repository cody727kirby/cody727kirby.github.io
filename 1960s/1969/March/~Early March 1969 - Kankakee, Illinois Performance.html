Their father, Thomas, owned the building.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...Jeff Jones was on Easter break in his sophomore year from Morehouse College in Atlanta.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I came home and helped Dad at the skating rink,&quot; he said. &quot;Dad said, &#39;We&#39;re having a little dance. Do you want to run the concession stand?&#39; It was an interesting time. It was just a gig for me and (the Jackson 5), too.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jones recalled the rink being packed with a lot of young kids and teenagers from the black community.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I thought they were amazing,&quot; said Murrell, who was a senior at Kankakee Westview High School. &quot;I didn&#39;t know they would become this famous. It was a good show.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jones recalled how Michael captivated the audience of 150 to 200.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;You could tell that Michael had a lot of talent,&quot; he said. &quot;Even though he was the lead singer, he could do more than that. He could dance and sing, and he shined. He was head and shoulders above his brothers.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;They seemed to all get along well. They were polished. I was surprised they were so polished for their age. There was a song Michael sang that had the girls screaming. I don&#39;t know what it was, but they really liked it.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...&quot;They were just a local group out of Gary,&quot; Jones said. &quot;They had their dad and a DJ from a radio station in the South Suburbs with them. They had a lot of airplay. The kids out here really liked them.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...&quot;I went back to school and when I came back that summer, they were on American Bandstand,&quot; Jones said.</span></p></body>
