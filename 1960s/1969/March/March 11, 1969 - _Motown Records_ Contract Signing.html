BERGER: Well, I managed -- I was their first manager when they joined Motown. It&#39;s interesting, because I only managed people that Barry Gordy was personally interested in. So I managed Smokey. I managed the Supremes. I managed the Temptations.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And one night I was getting off the road with the Supremes, and I got a telephone call from Barry Gordy and he said, &quot;We just signed this new group and you&#39;re going to manage them.&quot; He said, &quot;You have to come down to the studio right now.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I said, &quot;Why do I have to come down to the studio? You tell me I&#39;m managing them, I&#39;m managing them. I know what I have to do.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;No, no, no, no. You have to come down to the studio.&quot; OK. So I go down to the studio on Fairfax Avenue. There&#39;s five little kids. And he says, &quot;This is Shelley Berger. He manages Diane Ross. He manages Smokey Robinson. He manages Temptations. Now he&#39;s your manager. Show them what you can do.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And Michael just went into this James Brown thing. And I almost fell on the floor and I said, &quot;Sammy Davis has been reincarnated.&quot; You know? It was the same kind of electricity.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">KING: Wow, how long were you with him?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">BERGER: I was with him only for about a year and a half.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">KING: Those were good times, then? Easy?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">BERGER: Well, we just created something because Mr. Gordy, who, you know...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">KING: Berry&#39;s a genius.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">BERGER: He said to me, can we -- we were doing meetings and the agency, like, oh, we&#39;re going to get him on the Joey Bishop Show. We&#39;re going to get him.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">After the meeting Mr. Gordy said to me, &quot;What do you think?&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And I said, &quot;Let me ask you a question. Do you think you can get three No. 1 records on the Jackson 5?&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Now, only Barry Gordy can say this. He says, &quot;I already have it in the can.&quot; And I believed it.</span></p></body>
