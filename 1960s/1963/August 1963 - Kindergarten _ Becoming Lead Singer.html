Everyone of us in each class had to do something, so I went home and discussed it with my parents. We decided I should wear black pants and a white shirt and sing &ldquo;Climb Ev&rsquo;ry Mountain&rdquo; from The Sound of Music. When I finished that song, the reaction in the auditorium overwhelmed me. The applause was thunderous and people were smiling; some of them were standing. My teachers were crying and I just couldn&rsquo;t believe it. I had made them all happy. It was such a great feeling. I felt a little confused too, because I didn&rsquo;t think I had done anything special. I was just singing the way I sang at home every night. When you&rsquo;re performing, you don&rsquo;t realize what you sound like or how you&rsquo;re coming across. You just open your mouth and sing.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">&ldquo;TV Guide&rdquo; interview (November 10, 2001) (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://www.allmichaeljackson.com/interviews/tvguide01interview.html"><span class="cs8567212B">mirror</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">TV Guide:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> ...Do you remember the first time you ever stepped onstage?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael Jackson:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> I was 5 years old. And it was at a public school recital. We had to wear white shirts and short knickers. And I remember them saying, &quot;Little Michael Jackson is coming up to sing &#39;Climb Every Mountain.&#39;&quot; I got the biggest applause. When I went to my seat my grandfather and mother were crying.

We didn&#39;t dance. We watched and threw money.&quot; At Garnett Elementary School, Principal Gladys Johnson invited the boys to perform at an assembly. (Admission: 10&cent;. Proceeds split with the Jackson family.) About 1,200 students turned out, and this time around, not a rock was thrown. &quot;The children really enjoyed that show,&quot; Johnson remembers. &quot;I could not believe how they idolized those Jackson 5 boys.&quot; Johnson also kept an eye on Michael&#39;s academics, and once advised the fourth-grader to bone up on his math. &quot;My manager,&quot; Michael replied, &quot;will take care of my money.&quot;</span></p></body>
