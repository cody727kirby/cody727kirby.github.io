What I mean is, he would go right to the edge of the stage and he would - and this is a kid now - he would develop a rapport with the audience. Particularly with the people who were sitting close to the stage. And then the others as well.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Don Cornelius, Soul Train host, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://www.accesshollywood.com/articles/stars-colleagues-react-to-michael-jacksons-surprising-death-72932/"><span class="cs8567212B">Access Hollywood</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I met Michael Jackson at the age of eight &mdash; when his father and my new friend, Joe Jackson, first began to bring the Jackson 5 to Chicago, from their home in Gary, Indiana, for concert appearances. As the word of the Jackson 5&rsquo;s devastating abilities as concert artists had already begun to spread like an out-of-control forest fire-- to the, laser-like, attention of all Chicago area, R&amp;B Music Stars!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The prevailing thought process, among local, R&amp;B stars, with respect to this very young group of entertainers known as the Jackson 5, had become: &ldquo;If Michael Jackson &amp; his brothers were booked on an, upcoming, Chicagoland show &mdash; leave it alone!</span><span class="cs43C038A"> </span><span class="csD5D7D290">Don&rsquo;t book it &mdash; Don&rsquo;t go on that show and get completely blown away by young Michael and the Jackson 5!! Michael Jackson&rsquo;s, personal, crescendo of amazing power, as an entertainer &mdash; was clear and unmistakable.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Gladys Knight, singer, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/gladys-knight-discusses-h_n_221323"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;The Huffington Post&rdquo; (July 27, 2009)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190904195722/https://www.huffpost.com/entry/gladys-knight-discusses-h_n_221323"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">KNIGHT: Well, I met the Jacksons at the Regal Theater in Chicago.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">They were just children, actually, and I heard them before I saw them.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And I jumped up, and I said, &ldquo;Who is that?&rdquo;. They were rehearsing to do a talent show. And I ran to the banister to try to see who it was, and their father brought them up after their rehearsal, and I got a chance to meet them.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Amazing family. Michael was shy, and I don&rsquo;t know if we really recognized that in him all of his life. As he would accept awards, it wasn&rsquo;t about him being coy, it was about him being shy. I am so blessed that I was able to know Michael in a different way, seeing him in a room alone sitting in the dark and saying, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Michael?&rdquo;. Or sitting in the middle of the floor.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">We shared the same manager, Ron Wisener, at one time, and he was telling me the things that had happened or not happened in his life, like not going to a baseball game as a young boy. And asking me, &ldquo;how do you do this? How do you do that?&rdquo;. So many people that have called in this industry talk about Michael&rsquo;s inquiries. &ldquo;How do you do this? How do you go about making&rdquo; &mdash; it wasn&rsquo;t all about how you execute a note. It was about how do you live this life under the pressure and all of the things that we have to go through to make this happen.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Kennis Jones, &ldquo;Flairs&rdquo; musical group member, Chris Cadman&rsquo;s &ldquo;Michael Jackson the Maestro&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">[Kennis Jones confirms that one of the songs &ldquo;The Jackson 5&rdquo; performed was &ldquo;Steal Away&rdquo;.] &lsquo;We tied for first place with a group that was not known at the time, called the Jackson 5,&rsquo; confirmed Jones. &lsquo;A week later we came back to the Regal to break the tie with the Jackson 5, but they didn&rsquo;t show up for whatever reason.&rsquo;</span></p></body>
