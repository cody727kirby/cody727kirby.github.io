That year, an advertisement in a local newspaper caught Michael&#39;s father&#39;s attention. The advertisement was a call-out to musical groups to perform at a fashion show for a local modeling school. Joe Jackson decided he would take his sons to the audition.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">LaHaie, who owned the school and placed the advertisement, had more than 200 groups audition for the one-time performance. She recalls the Jackson Brothers showed real talent and potential, so LaHaie booked them to perform at the fashion show at The Big Top department store in Gary.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">However, LaHaie saw a problem with the group&#39;s name, the Jackson Brothers.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;So many groups at the time had names that ended in &#39;Brothers&#39; or &#39;Sisters,&#39;&quot; LaHaie said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;It was too common. I knew that they should have something different.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">LaHaie said the Jackson Five was the first name that came to her, and Joe agreed to change it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The group performed at the fashion show as the Jackson Five, a name that stuck until Michael Jackson left to continue his solo career.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">LaHaie said that she set the group up with one more performance at a Dyer hospital before they moved on with some of Joe Jackson&#39;s other contacts in the music industry.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Jermaine Jackson, &ldquo;You Are Not Alone&rdquo; autobiography (2011)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In today&rsquo;s light, I think it apt that our first true public performance as the Jackson 5 was on August 29, 1965: Michael&rsquo;s seventh birthday. No one noticed it at the time. Birthdays were like Christmas: non-events that were not marked in the house of Jehovah. But at least Michael&rsquo;s seventh birthday was different in that it wasn&rsquo;t another ordinary, unremarkable day.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Evelyn Lahaie, the lady who first suggested our group name, invited us to take part in a children&rsquo;s fashion event she had organized at the Big Top shopping center on Broadway and 53rd. She was the commentator on a &ldquo;Tiny Tots Jamboree&rdquo; and we were billed as &ldquo;The Jackson Five Musical Group: Another Spectacular Little Folks Band.&rdquo; All I remember is seeing a decent-sized crowd of young girls and Joseph telling us after the show to &ldquo;get down there and start selling your photos.&rdquo;</span></p></body>
